## Description

    Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

    This week we were tasked by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. to refactor their webpage to make it more accessible by meeting accessibility standards, so that their site is optimized for search engines. We completed various tasks to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 

### Tasks Completed

    Madee sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before elements or sections of the page.
